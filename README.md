# Healthcare Data Analysis and Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains two healthcare-focused data science projects:

1. **Health Care Analytics**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization to uncover trends and insights within healthcare datasets.
2. **Predicting Heart Disease**: Application of machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease, enhancing diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.

## Project 1: Health Care Analytics

### Overview
Health Care Analytics focuses on utilizing EDA and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from healthcare datasets. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform healthcare policies and decision-making.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
- Descriptive statistics: Summarizing key attributes of the dataset.
- Visualizations:
  - Bar charts for demographic trends.
  - Scatter plots showing relationships between variables like age and healthcare costs.
- Insights on:
  - Age-related healthcare costs.
  - Lifestyle risk factors.
  - Geographic disparities in healthcare access.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations.

## Project 2: Predicting Heart Disease

### Overview
This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data. By analyzing features like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure, the project highlights the potential of predictive analytics in healthcare.

### Key Features
- Dataset preprocessing:
  - Feature scaling and normalization.
  - One-hot encoding of categorical variables.
- Model selection:
  - Evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  - Achieved 85% accuracy with the Random Forest model.
- Model optimization:
  - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
  - Cross-validation for robust performance.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn for machine learning.
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing.

## Results

### Health Care Analytics
- Visualizations revealed correlations between age, lifestyle, and healthcare costs.
- Identified high-risk groups based on demographic and geographic factors.

### Predicting Heart Disease
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (85%).
- Key predictors: cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and age.

## Future Work
- Enhance visualizations with interactive dashboards using Plotly or Tableau.
- Explore deep learning models for improved accuracy in heart disease prediction.
- Integrate real-time data analysis with Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
